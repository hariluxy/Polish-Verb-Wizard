# Polish Verb Wizard

**Note:** The Polish Verb Wizard is currently under development. It is capable of performing two tasks as of now:

1. **Verb Classification**:

   - Classifies a given list of Polish verbs into four categories:
     - **Imperfective**
     - **Perfective**
     - **Both**
     - **Unrecognized**

2. **Conjugation Patterns Learning**:

   - Performs the same classification as above but also incorporates the first and third person singular forms to help learn conjugation patterns.
