# Polish Verb Wizard

**Note:** The Polish Verb Wizard is currently under development. It is only capable of performing two tasks as of now:

1. **Verb Classification**:

   - Given a file with a list of verbs in polish, It will analyze this list and output a results.txt. In this file, the provided verbs will be classified into four verb groups:
     - **Imperfective**
     - **Perfective**
     - **Both**
     - **Unrecognized**

2. **Conjugation Patterns Learning**:

   - If the user checks a box in the GUI. The program will provide the same output but this time with extra information next to the verbs. The conjugation of these verbs in first and third person of the    present singular. These two conjugations will provide the required information for polish learners to determine to which conjugation group they belong
